## 1.Project Title

Text Classification Using NLP: Categorizing News Articles

## 2.Description

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text documents into predefined categories. The dataset consists of news articles, and the goal is to predict the correct topic/category of each article.

## 3.Features

-Text preprocessing (Remove HTML Tags,Lowercasing,Remove stopwords)

-Model training and evaluation using various algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks)

-Model accuracy metrics (e.g., F1-score, precision, recall)

-Data visualization of results

-Cross-validation for model performance testing

## 4.Technologies Used

-Python

-Numpy, Pandas

-scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

-NLTK (for NLP tasks like removing stop words)

-Jupyter Notebook(for notebook-based workflows)

## 5.Dataset

-Name:IMDB Dataset.csv

-Get dataset from Kaggle

-Dataset has two columns this movies review and sentiment

## 6.Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request if you want to contribute.

## 7.Acknowledgements

- scikit-learn
  
- NLTK
  
- The dataset creators

## 8.Future Work

We plan to implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformers) for improved text classification.
